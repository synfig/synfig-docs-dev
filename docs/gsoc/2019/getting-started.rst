Application FAQs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Q: What will most help my odds of acceptance?**

A: There are a number of things you can do to help your odds

1. A quality proposal - a well thought out proposal that shows you understand what you want to do and have reasonable expectations about what can be accomplished in the time you will have available.
2. Show evidence of past experience or achievements related to the proposal.
3. We require you to have 1-2 useful contributions to Synfig before the program starts - this show that you can successfully read, edit, and compile our code.
4. Discuss your application with us and get some feedback. The best way to do so is to open an issue on GitHub with description of your proposal (make sure to specify in title that is is GSoC-related).

**Q: Is there some place that tells me the process of compiling Synfig?**

A: See [this documentation](https://synfig-docs-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/building.html).

**Q: Where can I learn basics of Synfig's functionality?**

A: We recommend to become familiar with existing Synfig functionality before you start any coding. You can start with [beginner's tutorials](https://wiki.synfig.org/Category:Tutorials). Also, you can request a free access to [our video training course](https://www.udemy.com/synfig-studio-cutout-animation-en/), which allow you to grab all basicsin the shortest time. Just mail us via [contact page](https://www.synfig.org/contact/) letting us know that you are aspiring GSoC student - and we will send you a link for free access.
