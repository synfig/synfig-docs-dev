Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Apache Netbeans IDE is recommended for Synfig Studio development. The Installer automatically prepares the IDE so that it comes with all required plug-ins, the correct workspace encoding settings, pre-configured code formatters and more. Simply follow these steps:

    * Download the `Netbeans Installer. <https://netbeans.apache.org/download/>`_
    * Launch the Netbeans IDE and go to tools -> plugins.
    * Go to Settings tab and enable **Netbeans 8.2 plugins portal**:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_plugin_settings.png

    * Go to Available plugins and click on **check for newest**.
    * Now select and install C/C++ plugin:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_cpp_plugin.png


Setup New Synfig Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IDE Installation is now completed so let's configure our new synfig project.

    * Click file -> new project 
    * Select C/C++ and C/C++ Project with Existing Source:

        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_choose_project.png

    * Select your synfig source file directory
    * Under **Select configuration mode** select **custom** and press next:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_select_mode.png

    * Click next and skip the Pre Build Action(do not check any option).
    * Under Build Action uncheck the **clean and build after finish** and click next:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_build_actions.png

    * Now click next on step 5 and step 6 without making any changes.
    * Click finish:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_setup_finish.png


Setting up make configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now we will configure make settings for our synfig project.

    * Right click on project(Synfig) and select properties:
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_make_1.png

    * Under Build -> make section change Build result so that it points to "_debug/build/bin/synfigstudio":
        
        .. image:: ../images/netbeans_make_2.png

    * Press apply and ok.


**Yay! your Netbeans IDE is now configured and you can use all the functionalities including debugging etc.**
