Skeleton Tool (GSoC-2020) [DRAFT]
=====================================================

Implementation Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Main functions of the tool are:

- Create and Transform Bones:
    - Single click would add a default bone with all the handles. 
    - Mouse-Down and Drag will add bone between the points dragged.
    - The handles will have their usual functions for transforming the bones.
- Set Parent-Child Relations:
    - I’d like to propose “Active bone” for this. This can be set by Double-Clicking on a bone. Active Bone can be differentiated by adding a red outline or a blue highlight.
    - Once an Active Bone is set, all the bones created later will be children to that bone.
    - For changing relations, we’ll add an option “Set as child to current Active Bone” in the context menu of the bone. The meaning is self-explanatory.
    - In the tool options, we add a list that shows all the bones and their parent-child relations in the skeleton layer. (if possible)
